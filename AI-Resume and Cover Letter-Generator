# 🧠 AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator using Zapier + OpenAI + Google Docs

### 🚀 How It Works
1. Candidate fills out a **Google Form** with their details
2. **Zapier** triggers OpenAI (ChatGPT) to generate:
   - Professional summary
   - Cover letter
3. Zapier fills a **Google Docs** template with the data and AI outputs
4. Zapier converts it to PDF and sends it to the candidate via **Gmail**
